Docker image for Cisco Yang Explorer https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/yang-explorer

```docker run --rm -p8000:8000 rdkls/yang-explorer```

Then visit http://localhost:8000

The admin (http://localhost:8000/admin/) creds are admin:admin

Note the UI is in Flash, so this needs to be installed/enabled

Flash is very insecure and there are STILL zero-days out there so DO NOT INSTALL FOR/ENABLE FOR UNTRUSTED SITES

On Chrome, the easiest way to enable is visit the site e.g. http://localhost:8000, then on the left of the URL bar click the â“˜ info icon -> Site Settings -> Flash -> Allow then restart chrome
